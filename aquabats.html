	<h3>The Aquabats! Super Show!</h3>
	<div class="normal-body">
		<p>The creator of this show (who also created Yo Gabba Gabba!) is the lead singer of the band "The Aquabats!" formed in the mid 90s. And, obviously, the band is the focal point of the show, but not in the way you would assume. The band is a group of super heroes in super hero costumes that take the viewer on their many adventures. Unfortunately this show isn't available on any subscription services.</p>
		<p class="italic">Goofy and nostalgic, “The Aquabats Super Show” — starring the alt-rock band featured in “Yo Gabba Gabba” — is a quirky throwback to a bygone era, a cheap spoof of the children’s TV of baby boomers’ youth, down to crappy production values and awful-looking “monsters” that work to its advantage. Although this Hub series at times feels like an “SNL” skit stretched to a half-hour, its sly mix of music, live-action crime-fighting, cartoons and mock ads ought to develop a cult following — and might be more popular with parents, at least those with the geek gene, than their kids.</p>
