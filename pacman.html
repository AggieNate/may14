	<h3>Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures</h3>
	<div class="normal-body">
		<p>Regardless of whether or not you like Pac-Man, the great story-telling sets this show apart. I'll often watch entire episode with my kids before realizing that I just sat through a half-hour cartoon and was invested in the story the entire time.</p>
		<p class="blockquote">Far from the two-dimensional dot-matrix world of his classic video game, PAC-MAN AND THE GHOSTLY ADVENTURES gives Pacster an intriguing back story, a couple of comical BFFs, and a selfless purpose of saving the world to fulfill his destiny. Known as "The Yellow One" by his enemies, the last of a race lethal to the ghosts and thought to be extinct, Pacster faces his heroic destiny head-on and shoulders responsibility for the entire world. What's more, he leans on his friends for help and turns to others for guidance when it's needed. In other words, there's a lot of potential in this vibrant, action-packed series.</p>
