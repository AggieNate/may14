	<h3>Ask the StoryBots</h3>
	<div class="normal-body">
		<p>Just look up the StoryBots T-Rex song on youtube. It's amazing.</p>
		<p class="italic">The animated show is both educational and entertaining in every scene yet is visually appealing as well as humorous enough to make both children and parents laugh out loud. While the premise of Ask the Storybots is to answer a child's question, the antics that the characters get themselves into are very funny, and each episode always has an educational twist without being obvious. For instance, when trying to find out how airplanes fly, viewers will learn how green screens are used to make it look like superheroes fly, that penguins can't fly, and how the bald eagle represents America, but these facts are cleverly communicated through great comedic writing.</p>
