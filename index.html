	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<div class="normal-body">
		<p>As the father of two kids (a six-year-old boy and a four-year-old girl), I have become something of a connoisseur of children's programming. And, as anyone with children knows, there's an abundance of options out there now that subscription services (such as Netflix, Hulu, etc.) are so common. Netflix alone has a US subscriber base of around 55 million.</p>
		<p>I was a child of the 80s, and we didn't have an endless library of shows to choose from at our fingertips. I remember waking up on Saturday mornings and watching Saturday-morning cartoons on network TV. I know my kids take the ability to watch pretty much anything at any moment for granted, but I'm OK with that. Technology advances and moves forward - it's beter to embrace it than try to resist it.</p>
		<p>Inevitibly, I've watched a lot of children's programming over the past six years. A lot of it is terrible, but a lot of it is surprisingly good. So I've put together a list of the shows I enjoy the most as a 35-year-old parent (in no particular order).</p>
