	<h3>The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!</h3>
	<div class="normal-body">
		<p>Honestly, this show isn't that good. It just holds a nostalgic place in my heart. Due to it's availablity on Netflix, though, my son - who loves all things Mario - loves this show. I enjoy watching bits and pieces of it with him on occasion and re-living my own childhood. But, man, this show is cheezy.</p>
		<p class="italic">Anyone who wasn't, uh, fortunate enough to have seen the Super Show back in the day missed a classic gaming cross-promotional vehicle; aside from the pair of Zelda CDI games, the Super Mario Bros. television show has simply got to go down as the biggest offender among Nintendo's many embarrassing moments. This isn't to say the show didn't have its charm, because the combination of live action sketches and animated shorts hit in a big way, winning numerous awards during its run. Looking back, however, the shows are amazingly corny and offer little to no appeal to anyone aside from the masochistic TV obsessives (ie: Hardcore Nintendo fans).</p>
